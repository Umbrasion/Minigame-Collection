/*
	Gameplay plans:
	
	Standard card battler where all cards have health and damage values
	The player has their own health as well
	The grid has 4 front spaces and 2 back spaces
	As long as 2 cards on the front row are present, the player cannot be damaged, unless a card has a special ability to do so
	Once the front row has 1 or fewer cards, the player can attack the opposing player directly (or attack the remaining cards, if any exist)
	Back row cards cannot attack or be hit, but will have other effects
	Most cards have different uses depending on if they are in the front row or the back row
	Some cards will only have uses in one row, making them only effective in that row
