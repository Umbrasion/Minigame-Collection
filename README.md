# Umbra's Game Collection
Welcome to my game collection, a place where I make minigames on a website for the purpose of messing with them on my podcast. Here's a list of the available games you can try out:

# Kiss, Marry, Kill
The classic game with a random character generator for your selection of studs to choose between. Thousands of characters can show up, making it replayable endlessly.

# Smash or Pass
Using the same character list as the Kiss, Marry, Kill, you go through all characters available and decide if you'd like to smash them or pass on them.
